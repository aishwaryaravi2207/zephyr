                <h2 class="heading-two">Our Story</h2>
                <p class="paragraph-two">My name is Julie Martin and my husband and I own Zephyr Ice in Portland, ME. On
                    a trip to Hawaii in 2017 we had shave ice for the first time and it blew our minds. It had ice cream
                    in the bottom, and then soft, fluffy ice and fruit syrups. My husband grew up making ice cream with
                    his family, and he really wanted to recreate the macadamia nut ice cream that we had. He also had
                    over 20 years of bartending experience and could make delicious fruit syrups. After we were home
                    from that trip, I bought us an ice shaver to make the sweet treat at home, and it was coming out
                    REALLY good. We realized there was nothing like it where we were in Maine and thus our business was
                    born. We started out as a mobile food cart in 2020 and have expanded by signing a lease at a brick
                    and mortar in 2021.</p>
